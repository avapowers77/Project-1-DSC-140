# Project-1-DSC-140
This project contains a data analysis of the Titanic Data Set, as well as all code used to create graphs and perform any and all calculations needed to analyze the data. 
The following calculations were conducted:
- A histogram of a column of numerical data.
- A pie chart of a categorical column of data.
- A scatter plot of two numerical columns of data, including a linear regression line, the equation, and R value on the plot.
- Another figure of my choice that conveys something interesting about the data.
- A contingency table comparing two categorical columns including a chi-square test and an interpretation of my findings. 
- Two sets of numerical data makes sense to compared against one another.
